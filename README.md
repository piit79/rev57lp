**WARNING: This is a work in progress. The PCB design has not been verified yet.**

Low-profile 57-key ergonomic keyboard inspired by Reviung41. Uses hotswap sockets for Kailh Choc V1 (PG1350) switches.

Based on [reviung-ish](https://github.com/fredbabe/reviung_ish_pcb) by oddkeeb.

Main differences from Reviung41:

* Added number row
* Added two more bottom row keys
* Added one extra middle key
* Uses hotswap sockets for Kailh Choc V1 switches with Choc spacing (18x17 mm)

Further modifications made by 42. Keebs:

* 2x 1u space key instead of a 2u with a Choc stabiliser, because nobody likes stabs
* Slightly increased angle of the sides from 13° to 15°
* Added power switch and a battery footprint
* Mounting holes changed to through holes for 3 mm standoffs for use with a switch plate and a bottom plate
* Dropped the middle matrix column to free up one I/O pin
